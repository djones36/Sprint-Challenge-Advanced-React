ComponentDidMount: is a method available only for one time when the component mounts to the DOM.
ComponentWillReceiveProps: is a mothod invoke as soon as props are updated before a new render.  
ComponentDidUpdate: is a method called after rendering.

- [ x] What is the purpose of a custom hook?

The purpose of custom hooks is to allow the Dev to create meaningful logic that can be reused throughout the app. Resusing the same hook will save time and make your code cleaner.
